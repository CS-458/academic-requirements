# Four Year Schedule Planner
This web application is intended for the use of University of Wisconsin-Stout students who seek to develop a four-year plan, or a plan spanning a customized number of years, for a specific program offered by the institution. The application is designed to aid students in crafting a personalized path to achieve their academic and career objectives.

The application provides users with the ability to save one or multiple schedules for later reference or editing. Additionally, pre-generated four-year plans are available to assist users in jumpstarting their planning process. The application incorporates a set of tools aimed at guiding users in ensuring they fulfill all necessary requirements mandated by UW-Stout.

## Running

First, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To update locally installed dependencies, run `npm install`. This needs to be
run at least once before the project can be run locally.

To run the local dev server, `npm run dev`. This will run the dev server on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Repository Structure

Next.js structures the repository a little bit differently than plain React.

- `pages/`: Contains all of the processed typescript to render each page
- `public/`: Contains unprocessed files (e.g. images, etc)
- `styles/`: Contains CSS files
