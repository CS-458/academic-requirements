## Running

First, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To update locally installed dependencies, run `npm install`. This needs to be
run at least once before the project can be run locally.

To run the local dev server, `npm run dev`. This will run the dev server on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Repository Structure

Next.js structures the repository a little bit differently than plain React.

- `pages/`: Contains all of the processed typescript to render each page
- `public/`: Contains unprocessed files (e.g. images, etc)
- `styles/`: Contains CSS files
