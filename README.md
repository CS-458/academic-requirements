# Four Year Schedule Planner
This is a Web Application that allows a UW-Stout student to create a Four Year Plan (or a custom number of years).
It is designed to help a student create their desired path for one of UW-Stout's various programs.

The user can save one or many schedules to find out which one is their favorite or work on it later. They user can 
also load a pre-generated Four-Year Plan to help kick start the process. There are tools set up to help guide the 
user into making sure they have meet all of the requirements UW-Stout has set.

## Running

First, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To update locally installed dependencies, run `npm install`. This needs to be
run at least once before the project can be run locally.

To run the local dev server, `npm run dev`. This will run the dev server on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Repository Structure

Next.js structures the repository a little bit differently than plain React.

- `pages/`: Contains all of the processed typescript to render each page
- `public/`: Contains unprocessed files (e.g. images, etc)
- `styles/`: Contains CSS files
